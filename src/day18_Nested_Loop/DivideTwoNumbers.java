/*
1. Write a program that can divide two positive numbers without using / (division) and * (multiplication) and %  operators.
        20 without / operaror.  6 ==> 3 with the reminder of 2
        6

        a=20
        b=6

        we will subtract second number from first until we come reminder there is no number or second is bigger than first
        a-=b;   // a=14;
         a-=b;   // a=8;
          a-=b;   // a=2; ==> 6 is bigger than 2 and loop will finish

          while (a >=b) it will stop when a<b
                    a-=b;
                    count++; // count give us how many times we did the subtraction operator.
                    what is a has laft at the end is reaminder
