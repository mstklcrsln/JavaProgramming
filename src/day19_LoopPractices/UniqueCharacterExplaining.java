           IMPORTANT :
            what is outer loop is doing? It is picking the characters and than the inner loop is going to compare that character wits each character of string. Than it is matching it is going to increase count  by one.
            the outer loop gives the characters one by one to inner loop and inner loop compares each character  one by one, if it matches than count will increase by 1 and we find freq
            inner loop compares each character that outer loop picked, which each character of the string
            in the outer loop char ch is j, but in the outer loop ch each is i

        how to i find the freq of one character?  This one character (a) i will compare every single characters of the string.
        so which means i ll get every single character from the string. we use 1 variable to store the 'a''s value
